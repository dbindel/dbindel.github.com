On a long bus ride home, I listened to old episodes of RadioLab,
and the guy telling the story talked about vividly remembering a
resraurant that he always walked past and dreamed about, but never
visited.  And then I remembered the tapas place in North Berkeley that
I used to walk past during my first year of graduate school.  It was
on my way home, and I usually walked back late enough that most of the
stuff around was closed.  The folks inside looked like they were
enjoying themselves.  I never actually went in.  I wonder if it's
still open now?
