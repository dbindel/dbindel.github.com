title:  Messing about in MATLAB
tags:   [fiver, math, technology]

[Nick Trefethen](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/) came to
Cornell for a visit yesterday, where he gave 
[two talks](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~scan/index-f13.html).
In one talk, he described some
computations based on sampling analytic functions around the unit
circle; in the other, he demonstrated the Chebfun system
[Chebfun](http://www2.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/).  I've seen variants
of the latter talk before, but it was worth seeing again.
The philosophy of the talk reminds me of a line from the start of
*The Wind in the Willows*, in which the Water Rat tells Mole:

> Believe me, my young friend, there is NOTHING -- absolutely nothing --
> half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.

Replace "boats" with "MATLAB", and I think you have the raison
d'&ecirc;tre for Chebfun.  This is not to say that Chebfun couldn't be
used to serious ends, but rather that it's great fun to mess about
with it; and Trefethen conveys that sense of fun masterfully.
