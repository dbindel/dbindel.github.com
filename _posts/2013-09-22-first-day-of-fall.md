Here are some lessons I have learned in the first days of this
semester, which I will share with you on this first day of fall.

1. If you must type while a cat is attacking your arm, use vi and not
   emacs.  Chorded key strokes are murder.  Also, long sleeves are
   helpful.

2. A collection of letters on the Kindle app on my cell phone makes a
   marvelous companion in the event that I show up a early for a
   colloquium.  Seneca's letters are more interesting and better
   written than anything that shows up in my email, and each one takes
   but a few minutes to read -- about the same amount of time it takes
   to debug the typical A/V problem, or possibly less.

3. Human beings are 
   [awesome throwers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq6dCFCMGq4).
   Also, I am [in awe of Indian bakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-r7z6JFwbk).

4. I am glad my daughter is getting old enough to appreciate Pixar
   movies.  We watched Ratatouille as a family this weekend, and G's
   commentary added a certain savor to the movie.  Then G fell asleep,
   and I savored that, too!

5. Combing curly hair is *far* easier with a brush than with a comb.
   Also, I need to buy some new combs, since all my combs are now
   snaggle-toothed from trying to work them through G's curls before
   J asked "why are you doing it that way?"
