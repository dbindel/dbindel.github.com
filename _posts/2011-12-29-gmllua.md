[Graph Modelling
Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) (GML) is a
declarative format that is accepted by a variety of network analysis packages.
I've recently found myself in a position where I want to do a variety of
processing and translation tasks with GML files.  For example, I really like
[yEd](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html) for graph layout,
so I wanted to use yEd to import a GML file describing a graph, make a nice
layout, export the result back to GML, and then produce a nice picture with
[TikZ](http://www.texample.net/tikz/) for use in a presentation.  Along the
way, I also wanted to generate the adjacency matrix for the graph in a form
that I could load into MATLAB.

Unfortunately, when I read a GML file into yEd and then write out a
GML file, I lose any information that yEd doesn't care about.  And while
it's easy enough to write stupid scripts to do things like turning a GML file
into a MATLAB adjacency matrix, it's decidedly messier to do something that
involves combining a source GML file, some MATLAB vectors representing node
properties, and an output GML file from yEd.

Fortunately for me, the syntax of a configuration file in GML reminded me
an awful lot of the syntax of configuration files written in
[Lua](http://www.lua.org).  I've been a fan of the [Lua programming
language](http://www.lua.org/) for a long time, and have used it as the input
language for a couple of my finite element codes.  It's a small, fast language
that was built for embedding into bigger codes.  It grew out of a configuration
language for finite element codes, and it still makes an excellent
configuration language.  And, as it turns out, it makes an excellent language
for the sorts of processing tasks that I wanted to do with the GML files
on my drive.

Enter [gmllua](https://bitbucket.org/dbindel/gmllua), an extremely simple
Lua-based system for processing GML files.  It didn't take much time to write,
because there's not much to it: just a parser to convert GML files to Lua data
structures, and some functions that walk over the resulting tree and produce
useful output.  But that's all I really needed.
