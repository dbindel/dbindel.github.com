I have kept short to-do lists on paper for forever, and in the past I've always
had trouble when I tried to write electronic lists.  Usually, I fall into the
trap of writing electronic to-do lists with far too many items on them, so that
it's inconceivable that I might cross off the majority (or even a substantial
minority) of the items on the list in a single day.  I don't do that with paper
lists because I write more slowly than I type.  But paper lists don't
automatically maintain themselves, and it's easy forget to add dated items.

Enter [Gina Trapani's todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) shell script and Android
application, which I have been using happily for the past couple weeks.  The
nice thing about this is that it's just an ordinary text file and some shell
scripts to maintain it, and so I can integrate it into a pre-exsting system of
scripts and files.  I keep a list of projects, ideas, etc. in an [Emacs org
mode](http://orgmode.org/) file, and when I started using the todo script, I
made one minor extension: a little script that goes through my projects file,
pulls out dated tags, and adds them to my todo list.  That way, the todo list
does not get so long that I start ignoring it, but it's constantly refreshed
with things that I realized some time before that I would need to do on this
day.

And now I get to cross writing here from my to-do list for today.
