I turned in my grades last Friday, then spent the next several days
away from Ithaca on travel.  I was going for family reasons, but many
others in the department seem to have chosen this week for travel for
professional reasons.  Whatever the reasons, a trip away is a good
bookend to the semester.

Spring is over.  Summer is here.  It is a time for quiet and
concentration, a time when I can work in a straight line for eight
hours or more without the distraction of meetings or knocks at the
door.  I love it.
