I'm thankful for standards and software that supports them.  I can now
charge my wife's phone and my phone using the same micro-USB connector.  My
machine can talk to a wide variety of printers without me worrying about
getting the right drivers and fiddling with some file in the `etc`
subdirectory.  I haven't had to worry about IRQ conflicts in ages.

I'm thankful for ubiquitous networking and the services it supports.  I
grumble about email sometimes, and sometimes I think better when disconnected.
But it's really handy to have my email and my calendar available whenever and
wherever, and to be able to Google things.

I'm thankful for cheap GPS.  My cell phone has a better sense of direction
than I do.  How cool is that?

I'm thankful for improvements in battery technology (though we still have a
ways to go).

I'm thankful for high level programming languages.  Since I started
programming, it has gotten way easier to put together interesting software
prototypes for ideas, and to avoid constantly writing boilerplate code.

I'm thankful that the week after Thanksgiving is the last week of
instruction for the semester!
