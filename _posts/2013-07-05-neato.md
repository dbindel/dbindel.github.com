When I was a freshman in high school, I took a class called Data
Processing.  This was an introductory programming class, taught in
BASIC at the time.  I'd already been programming in BASIC for a few
years at that point, so I tended to finish the assignments early.
This left me with a lot of leftover time sitting in front of the
computer in the labs.  Rather than twiddling my thumbs, I played with
the graphics on those machines.  The result was a set of simple demo
programs that made pretty pictures, creatively named NEATO1, NEATO2,
etc.  The floppy disk on which they were saved still probably sits in
a box at my parents home, though I no longer own the hardware that
would read it.

I still write such codes today -- little one-off programs to try out
an idea or just to see what happens -- but now these codes cross a
half dozen languages, and they tend to relate to my research.  If I
were a freshman in high school today, what would my "neato" programs
look like, I wonder?
