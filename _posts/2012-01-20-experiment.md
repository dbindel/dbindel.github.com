I'm trying an experiment this semester, and putting part of my lecture
for [CS 3220](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/cs3220-s12) online in
the form of YouTube videos.  The hope is that this will let me spend
my class hours more interactively.  So far, only the [first one is
up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRAJSfQY_7c&feature=youtube_gdata_player).
That first video doesn't contain any technical content -- it mostly just
explains why I'm doing this -- but it was easy enough to put it together
that I'm convinced that recording and posting the videos will not be all
that onerous.

Instruction starts Monday.
