Google's ad engine has decided that I really want a Livescribe pen.  I
can tell, because the ad follows me *everywhere*.  I don't really
mind, and it makes a certain amount of sense: this is the type of
gadget that normally appeals to me.  But... I write with a fountain
pen when I can.  At the moment, my everyday pen is a Waterman Phileas,
and my preferred ink is from Noodler's.  I enjoy that too much to
shrug and switch to a digital pen.

So how do I convey this information to Google?
