[Stephen Colbert interviewed Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2010/01/29/stephen-colbert-interview-montclair-kimberley-academy)
out of character talking about science and society, about two years ago.  And
it's excellent for two reasons.  First, it's a lot of fun to watch Colbert
citing Latin roots and wisecracking on Oedipus.  Second, Tyson is a passionate
guy.

It's a good way to cap a long semester.
