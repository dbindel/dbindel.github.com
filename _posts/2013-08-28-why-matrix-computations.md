title:  Why Matrix Computations?

As of a few minutes ago, enrollment in [matrix computations][1] this
semester stands at 35.  We're capped at 40 due to room capacity.
More students would mean more work.  I still hope a few more sign up,
because this is an awesome topic to study.  Why?  It's a one-two combo:

1. Linear algebra is some beautiful math, right up there with complex
   analysis.  It's also fantastically useful.  Want to understand
   continuum mechanics?  Nonlinear dynamics and bifurcations?
   Statistics?  Control theory?  Signal processing?  Modern graph
   theory?  Hey, I've never even figured out how anyone could
   effectively use calculus without understanding linear algebra!

2. Computers let us engineer math, including continuous mathematics.
   In one way, this is old stuff: numerical methods comprise some of
   the oldest algorithms in computer science, and scientific computing
   was the chief purpose of many of the pioneering machines.  These
   days, different forces drive the computing industry: games and big
   data analysis are arguably hotter topics than climate simulation.
   But good luck producing 3D graphics, computer sound, or search
   engines without a solid numerical base!
   
So why learn numerical linear algebra?  Not because I'm
the [highest energy lecturer in the world][2], nor has matrix computations
suddenly become the most fashionable sub-field in computer science.
But linear algebra is the raw structural material of numerical
computation.  We know how to make linear algebra computations strong
and lightweight, and we know how to compose factorizations to build
fantastic things.  The body of numerical knowledge is tremendous, but
matrix computations are the bones that support that body.

See you in class tomorrow.  Get the book, it's a good one.  Oh, and
the first homework is up.
