Though they can make a big difference, the things that distinguish
carefully written numerical methods are often easy to miss, unless
you're looking for them.  A few come to mind:

1.  Careful codes use structure.  Matrices that are sparse or
    symmetric are treated as such, structures that are supposed to be
    conserved by the physics are conserved (at least approximately) bt
    the methods, and some attention is paid to things like
    monotonicity.
2.  Careful codes compute corrections.  Computing a correction to an
    approximate answer is often easier than computing the "right"
    answer directly.  And trying to get an answer in closed form is
    sometimes not a very useful computational tactic --- it's better
    to think in terms of iterations that apply a series of corrections
    (though direct methods are fine where appropriate!).
3.  Careful codes have meaningful safeguards.  This is sometimes
    mis-interpreted as "lots of safeguards," leading to codes that are
    impossible to read because they spend so much time checking on
    conditions that can clearly never happen and that have no
    particular relevance.
4.  Careful codes are backed by both testing and analysis.  Ideally,
    the analysis should guide the design of the test cases.
