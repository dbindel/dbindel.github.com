title:  Approximately better

Joe was a good kid.  You'd have liked him if he were in your class: he
worked hard, he cared about the material, he tolerated the bad jokes.
And he got it, mostly.  He knew how to write a proof, and could turn
out code that mostly worked most of the time.  He mostly made life better
for everyone in the class, professors and students alike.

But like most of us, Joe had a flaw.  He was in love with the Right
Answer.  Given the choice between a one-line argument to show $x$ is
between $2.5$ and $3$ or a ten-page argument showing 
$x = \exp(-\pi/2)/\phi$, Joe would pull out a pad and start filling
pages with algebra.  Never mind that all that mattered for the
application at hand was that $x < 10$!  Equalities made Joe
comfortable; inequalities filled him with a vague dread.  In times of
stress or uncertainty, he fled back to the land of equations, even if
the roads through that land were treacherous and unlikely to lead to a
satisfactory end.

Joe, of course, didn't see his inability to approximate as a problem.
He was very proud of his ability to get the Right Answer, and was
always a bit condescending toward friends who had better taste and
trained in the art of back-of-the-envelope estimation.  Fortunately,
he was well socialized, if a bit arrogant, and so mostly managed not
to be insufferable when he was invited to cocktail parties, even when
the topic turned to things technical -- as it almost invariably will
when there are enough scientists and engineers gathered in one place.

After a couple years, Joe graduated with good grades and a respectable
degree, then joined Teach For America.  I understand that he fell in
love with teaching high school math, and continued on with it after
his stint with Teach For America ended.  He's married now and has a
kid, which makes me feel old; he seemed so young himself, not that
long ago!  I'd mostly not thought about him for years until a few days
ago, when he wrote me an email saying he was in town and asking if we
might go have a coffee.

"So," he said as we sat down at the cafe, "I've decided that you were
right about something way back when."  I replied that I hoped I was
right about more than one thing, but asked which thing he had in mind.
"You were right," he replied, "when you said that there's some value
in approximation even when an exact answer is available."  I was
surprised to hear those words coming out of Joe's mouth, and asked
what inspired the revelation, and he told me that one dreary day when
he was sitting with his little girl, she asked him where the sun goes
when it rains.  He told her that the sun was still there, and
but that the clouds get in the way, and she said: "does that mean
the sun doesn't like to play in the rain?"

"Well," he said, "that's not really right, but maybe it's a good
approximately in the right direction."

"Daddy," she replied, "I like approximately better."
