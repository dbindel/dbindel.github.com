I get enough requests for student referrals from potential employers
that it seems like I should put together a standard polite response to
them.  This is that polite response.

The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), of which
Cornell is a member, publishes a
[Faculty Guide to Ethical and Legal Standards in Student Hiring](http://www.naceweb.org/legal/faculty_guide/).
According to this guide, it is recommended that we redirect requests
for student referrals to
[Cornell Career Services](http://www.career.cornell.edu/) so that it can
be posted openly for qualified candidates.
Given that Cornell makes it
[free to employers](http://www.career.cornell.edu/employers/hiring_students/posting/index.cfm)
to post full-time jobs, internships, and summer positions for current
students and recent grads (up to five years out), this seems like the
best strategy both for me and for any employers who might want to hire
my students.  Also, Career Services has people who help match people
with opportunities, schedule interviews, etc.
In any event, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
does not generally allow my to disclose student information outside
Cornell without prior consent of the student, so the best I can do is
to advertise, and Career Services is generally better at advertising
such things than I am.

Also, if you want to hire our top students, get a head start.  Many of
our top undergraduates have jobs lined up by the end of the fall
semester.
