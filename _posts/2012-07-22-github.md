I have moved these pages from the Cornell CS web server to
[github](http://github.com).  There are a few simple reasons for this:

1. I have other stuff that I really should be doing instead, but I'm
   cross-eyed from working on technical things all weekend.  Moving
   files from point A to point B lets me coast for a few minutes.
   
2. I'm already using Jekyll, so there's no real friction to the move.

3. There is real friction to using the CS web server, since I have to
   be logged into the Cornell VPN in order to get to it.
   
4. I've done a bit of coding this summer that I keep intending to move
   up to Github.  This seems like a good first step.
