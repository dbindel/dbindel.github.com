Continuing in my "let's play with GitHub" train of though,
I just put up [LDoc](ldoc/index.html), a literate programming tool
that I've been putting together on the side while developing a
little symbolic matrix algebra tool, which is itself a side project
that is supposed to make one of my finite element codes easier to
maintain.
