One of the glorious things about summer is that when 7:00 or so runs around,
I feel like I can safely switch to something other than my day job.  For
example, I can spend some time trying [Atom][atom]!  At least, I can spend
a minute or two before it is time to put the kids in the bath.

I would wax poetic about this, I'm sure, but I have only used it for all
of about ten minutes.  I am sure that tomorrow I will go back to my normal
mode of operation (emacs and vim both open, with a fountain pen and a pencil
  sitting next to a pad of paper by the keyboard).  But so far, I like it!
