I had the same conversation with students in my class three times today.  I
said, "I'm not sure what's wrong with your code, though this part looks
suspicious." I asked, "What was the last version of your code that worked?" 
And I said, "I would go back and re-implement this in tiny steps, making
sure at each stage that your code passes your test suite."  And then I
listed the steps that I went through, none of which involved more than a few
lines of code, and described the types of problems that they could run into
if each of those steps went awry.  And in each case, I heard "That makes
sense; I just wasn't sure how to break things down into smaller steps
than the one I took."

It's a funny thing: the only way I know to make progress sometimes is to
make mistakes constantly.  If I find the mistakes fast enough, there might
be little enough time between fixing one problem and creating the next so
that I at least don't get confused about where the problem is!
