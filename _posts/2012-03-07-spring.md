The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and the temperature is
supposed to go above 60 F today in Ithaca.  I might wish that this
weather had arrived two days ago for our visit day for prospective CS
graduate students.  But really: it's a beautiful day.  Spring is on
the way.  I have no cause for complaint.

Spring break for Cornell starts in a week and a half.  As an
undergraduate, I remember that I always looked forward to spring break
as a chance to catch up.  As a graduate student, I mostly didn't
notice that spring break existed.  Now, as a faculty member, I again
look forward to spring break as that most precious of things: a chance
at uninterrupted time to think.

Of course, I'll also have to do some grading, and I think many of my
meetings are still on, so in practice my time will will be a bit
fragmented.  Nonetheless, the thought of uninterrupted thinking time
is keeping me going!
