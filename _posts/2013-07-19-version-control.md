I have kept software and writing projects in version control since I
was an undergraduate.  I started with CVS, then moved on to
Subversion, then switched to git (though I sometimes dabble with
Mercurial).  These days, I tend to use git even when collaborating
with folks who use Subversion; the git-svn interface is pretty good,
and I *really* like having a local repository that is different from
the central, shared repository.

More recently, I've started using
[BitBucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) for most of my projects.  I
think [GitHub](http://www.github.com) is also a fine system -- that's
where these pages currently live! -- and I have collaborators who use
[Assembla](http://www.assembla.com) and
[CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com).  At one time, I also had some
projects on [SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net), and Cornell has
an institutional version of that same software.

I like [BitBucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) for a few reasons.  It's
a hosted service run by someone else, and I'm willing to let them
worry about security and backups -- though it helps that I don't work
on anything classified, and I do keep my own backups as a safety
blanket.  They have a pretty nice interface for browsing activity in
the common repository, and it's easy to give others access for
collaborative projects.  And they offer
[unlimited free private repositories for academic users](http://blog.bitbucket.org/2012/08/20/bitbucket-academic/).
This is appealing not only because I'm an academic user myself, but
because I can point my students at it.  This became especially
appealing about a year and a half ago, when I started noticing student
solutions to homework problems showing up in public GitHub
repositories.  On the one hand, I applaud the students for using a
modern version control and collaboration option; on the other hand,
grading gets tricky if everyone makes their course codes public!
