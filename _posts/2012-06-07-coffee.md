The CS department has an espresso machine, which I basically never
use.  For a while after the kitchen was spruced up, we had a simple
one-button model.  But that kept breaking down, until one day it
disappeared and was replaced by an older version.  I could learn to
use it, I suppose, but most days, I just make a pot of coffee with the
coffee maker in my office.  And whe I want something a little fancier,
I will go out.

Today was a day to go out.  The carpet in my office was just cleaned
this morning, so I'm trying to avoid working there; and in any event,
sometimes I enjoy a change of scenery.  So for now, I'm sitting in
Starbucks, having just finished one task and getting ready to move on
to the next one.
