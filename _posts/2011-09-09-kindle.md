I don't have a Kindle device, but I do have the Kindle app on my phone.
It would be nice if the battery life lasted longer, but otherwise I
like reading fiction on my phone.  It's easy to read one-handed,
easy to get books, and easy to read in poor lighting.

That said:

 * I'm not likely to use it for reference books any time soon.  It's 
   too hard to deal with footnotes.  Also, I have mixed feelings about
   the mathematical type.
 * I don't have to turn off a paper book during takeoff and landing.
 * I like talking about the books on the shelf when visitors come by.
 * I still like visiting the library.
 * Reading to the toddler is better with paper.
