It's almost May, and there are two weeks of instruction left in the
semester, including this one.  Last week, I could feel spring in the
air, with clear skies and temperatures in the upper 70s, sometimes
even the lower 80s.  And this morning, it is just below freezing with
a couple inches of snow on the ground.  Our poor flowers!  They just
went into the ground a couple weeks ago.

As an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, this was the type
of morning when I'd wake up and look forward to seeing a "sermon" in
my inbox from Sandy Mack, who at the time was the head of the
university honors program.  These little broadcast notes would point
out that, despite the weather and end-of-semester stresses, it's still
spring, and life is basically okay.  And maybe they'd suggest popping
popcorn with the lid off as a means of relieving stress.

Off to lecture now!  Maybe I'll tell them to pop popcorn with the lid
off while they study?  Probably not, but it's a thought.
