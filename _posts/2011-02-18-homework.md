I learn mathematics not through my eyes, but through my fingers.  I sympathize
with students who would prefer not to listen to me lecture.  If I were in their
shoes, I would probably find it more productive to work problems most of the
time.  I try to incorporate in-class problem-solving into my classes for
precisely that reason.  But there is not enough time in lecture to really dig
into a problem, getting lost on side tracks and running around in circles while
only gradually closing in on the answer.  To me, the value of homework lies in
that process of getting lost often enough so that your fingers can work past
the algebraic thickets without distracting the rest of you from your high-level
task.  It's hard to design homework problems that force students into the
algebraic thickets while providing both enough tools for them to make their way
through and enough connections to "the real world" so that nobody complains
that the homework is pointless.  But we try, and we keep trying.
