Like the new look?  I moved my software from 
[webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/)
to 
[jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
using a theme based on 
[Twitter's Bootstrap framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
I started from
[this template](https://github.com/jgritman/Jekyll-Bootstrap-Template)
and modified 
[someone else's modified "relevant posts" script](http://techtinkering.com/2011/08/17/improving-related-posts-on-jekyll/)
to work with tags.  Et voila!

Hey, it's a good break from proposal writing.
