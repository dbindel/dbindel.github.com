We're entering the time of the year when I get asked for professorial
advice.  Of course, I'm still figuring this whole thing out myself,
and would take anything I say with a grain of salt.  But for today,
my deepest and most heartfelt advice must be: take dessert seriously.

Yeah, nobody ever asks my opinion on dessert.  But that's my line for
tonight, and I'm sticking to it.
