I just put up the most recent iteration of
[my todo management system on Github](https://github.com/dbindel/tlua).
This is inspired by the [todo.txt system](http://todotxt.com/), and
uses essentially the same text format, so it is compatible with the
Android `todo.txt` app, for example.  But this version has some
features that I think are cool, like stopwatches on tasks, time
reports, automatically queued tasks, and repeating tasks.
