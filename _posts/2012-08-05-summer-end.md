We came home yesterday from a combined work-family trip, the last trip
of the summer.  In two weeks, another semester begins.  I start each
summer with a list of things that I intend to do, and I end each
summer disappointed that I didn't get to them all.  This summer is no
different.  Still, I've learned interesting things this summer, and
I've made some good progress.  I shan't complain.

The grass in the yard is brown and dying, evidence of weeks without
rain.  But we had rain today, and I hope more comes tonight.  Rain to
wash the humidity from the air, rain to cool us down so the weather is
not so stifling.  Rain to save the plants on the deck, maybe.  They've
suffered while we traveled.
