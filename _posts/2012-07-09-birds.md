The Detroit airport is loud a lot of the time.  Most airports are.
Every few moments, there is a TSA announcement, or a gate
announcement, or a request that someone go to the courtesy telephone.
The tram that runs from one end of the terminal to the other rumbles
overhead.  And, of course, there is a constant bustle of people.

But in the moments between all that, you can hear the birds in the
rafters.  I'm not sure how they got inside; and if they get in with
any regularity, I imagine the maintenance crews view them as pests.
But here and now, I'm glad to hear them.
