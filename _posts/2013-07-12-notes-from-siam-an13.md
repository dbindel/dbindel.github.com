title:  Notes from SIAM AN13

I'm writing this from the airport in Philadelphia, where I am half
through my return trip from the
[SIAM Annual Meeting](www.siam.org/meetings/an13/) in San Diego.  I
ran into a lot of familiar faces, including many I haven't seen for a
while -- the last big annual meeting that I attended was the
International Congress on Industrial and Applied Math (ICIAM) meeting
in Vancouver in 2011, though I've attended many smaller meetings in
the interim.

Though I came primarily to talk to some people, I enjoyed several of
the talks.  Nick Trefethen and Stan Osher both gave entertaining
plenary talks, which included both topics one might expect, like
Chebyshev polynomials and hyperbolic PDEs, and some that were a bit
more quirky.  Trefethen used a version of the "Snakes" computer game
to illustrate the Lebesgue constants for Chebyshev and uniform
interpolation, while I'm pretty sure that the video Osher used in one
of his examples was someone dancing Gangnam style.  In terms of
presentation pizzaz, though, it would be hard to beat this year's
[Block community lecture](www.siam.org/prizes/sponsored/block.php) by
Anette Hoisoi of MIT, which was (mostly) on biologically-inspired
design.  I'm entertained by just the idea of a robotic clam digging in
the sand or a robotic snail crawling in a trail of slime, but it's
hard to do justice to how excellent the presentation was without the
pictures.  Fortunately, the past few Block lectures were videotaped,
and are now available online, and I expect this year's lecture will
not be an exception.

At a more technical level, I really enjoyed both plenary talks on
Thursday afternoon: George Sugihara's lecture on correlation and
causality in nonlinear systems was intriguing and beautifully
explained, and Lexing Ying's lecture on interpolative decomposition
was a nice introduction to some of the key ideas underlying rapid
advances in fast direct (or near-direct) solvers for PDEs and integral
equations developed over the past few years.  I also particularly
enjoyed the minisymposia on advances in eigenvalue solvers (naturally)
and algorithms for manycore machines.

Of course, I missed a lot of talks I'm sure I would have also enjoyed.
The annual meeting is big enough that there are many, many parallel
sessions, and inevitably a few of the ones I find most interesting are
going to be in direct competition.  I missed a structured solvers
minisymposium that I'm sure I would have enjoyed in order to go to the
eigenvalue solver talks.  I also missed the Chebfun minisymposium on
Wednesday afternoon in order to attend the linear algebra contributed
presentations.  This made me particularly sad, because while
Trefethen's plenary talk was entertaining, it was stuff I've seen
before, and all very high-level stuff at that.  There's some nice
approximation theory underlying Chebfun, modern computational takes on
classic topics from complex analysis, Fourier analysis, the theory of
orthogonal polynomials, etc, and I would have enjoyed seeing some
talks with more details of those contributions.  But I'd already
agreed to chair the other session, and I was giving the first talk (on
a recent paper on
[Localization Theorems for Nonlinear Eigenvalues](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4668)
with Amanda Hood) -- and so it goes.

After four days of talks and socialization (and a red-eye flight), I'm
worn out, but happily so.  Time to go home, now, and I'm looking
forward to a quiet week in Ithaca before I head off to the next meeting.
