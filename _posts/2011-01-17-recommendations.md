If you are reading this, it is likely because I pointed you here after you
asked me for a letter of recommendation on your behalf, and I would like to
make a few points that might help us both.

You want references who think you are great and will support that opinion
with specific examples.  I may be able to recommend you warmly for many
reasons.  Perhaps you did interesting work in a class project or asked lots of
interesting questions in class, or perhaps you improved remarkably from a rocky
start.  I have written letters that praised students for all these reasons.  If
I ask you why you requested a letter from me in particular, I am probably
trying to put together in my mind the specific details that should go into your
letter.  If you think there are details I might have forgotten, feel free to
remind me.

Ideally, your references should provide a broad picture of your abilities,
with each recommender emphasizing different aspects.  To understand the broad
picture you are trying to convey, as well as the role my letter will play in
conveying this picture, it will help me to see your current CV and other
application materials, and it may be helpful to tell me who else is writing
recommendations for you.

Be clear about the logistical details.  Tell me about deadlines, about how
letters should be submitted, and about any specific requirements for the
letter.  As long as you don't pester me every day or two, I also won't mind if
you send me a reminder if the deadline draws close and I haven't already sent
something.  

If you are able, come talk to me in person about your recommendation.  It
makes life much easer.
