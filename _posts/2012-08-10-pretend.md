About a month ago, our daughter launched into the land of constant
pretend.  In any given hour, she switches from being a Spiderman to a
princess to a hippo to a hungry caterpillar.  And we change with her.
When she says "Say hi, baby caterpillar!", we follow her whims, and
for a moment, we are mommy and daddy caterpillar.

Being a professor can be fun, but being daddy caterpillar is its own
special kind of awesome.
