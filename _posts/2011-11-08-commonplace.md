A commonplace book is a sort of journal for keeping track of quotes,
references, ideas, and other odds and ends.  These books were once
more common than they are now, I think, though there are still those
who keep something similar (I'm a big fan of 
[Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/),
for example).

I keep notes on a variety of topics, but some are scattered throughout
my filesystem and others spill onto a zillion scraps of paper.  And
every so often, I find myself explaining some trick or idea --
yesterday it was the representation of complex numbers as two-by-two matrices,
today it was the idea that doubling the available storage when expanding
an array can ensure bounded amortized copy overhead per element.  And I
think, "if I kept better notes about when I learn tricks like this, I would
probably be able to tell them where I learned this."  But at the time,
it seemed more interesting to learn these tricks and start using them than
to write down where I first saw them.  Ah, well.
