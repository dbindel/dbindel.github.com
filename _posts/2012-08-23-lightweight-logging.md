I've been using my new
[Lua to-do system](https://github.com/dbindel/tlua) for a week and a
day now, and I've been reasonably consistent about turning on timers
when I'm doing something on task (and leaving them off when I'm taking
breaks).  That works out to almost exactly 60 hours of work time data,
and it's been interesting to see how that time breaks down.  The
records so far lead me to the following conclusions:

1. About half my time in the past week has gone toward coding (for a
   package that should *really* be released by September 1).  A
   typical task takes 15-45 minutes to complete.  There are some
   outliers, but most of the cases where I work for more than about 90
   minutes on a coding task reflect mistakes that I had to undo.

2. In the past two weeks, I've spent about two hours on class
   preparation.  I'm sure that number will go up as I start assigning
   homework, since those take time to write and to grade; but that
   feels like a good level of time committment given the preparatory
   work already done earlier in the year.
   
3. I lose IQ points immediately after faculty meetings, and am better
   off waiting for a little while to do anything very technical.

4. About an hour a day has gone into some form of focused technical
   writing.  This does not including things like writing emails,
   project ads, or lecture preparation.  It also does not include the
   related thinking time, much of which happens in the shower, while
   falling asleep, or at other times when I am nominally doing
   something not work-related.  Given that I'm trying to push
   out this code, I feel okay about that; but I could do better.

It will be interesting to see how this evolves over the course of the
semester.
