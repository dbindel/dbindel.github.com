I spent some time this week moving several of my project repositories
onto [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org), a project hosting service that
supports my current favorite version control system (git) and provides
unlimited public and private repositories to academic users.  If that
doesn't work out, it should be easy enough to clone my repositories
from there to some other site.  That is, after all, part of the point
of using a decentralized system like Git.

I also spent some time this week setting up virtual Windows and Linux
boxes on my Mac laptop.  I expect I'll primarily use these for testing
that my software builds and runs correctly in these environments, and I
hope it will be a good investment of time for the medium term.  But I also
hope that it's something I can discard in the long term, because I would
really much rather do these build-and-test tasks on some hosting service,
much as I would rather have my repositories live on some hosting service.
