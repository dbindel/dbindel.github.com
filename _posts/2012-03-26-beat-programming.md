There are elegant programs in the world, systems that impress you with
the simple, powerful way in which they solve fundamentally difficult
problems.  Some of these are almost like works of literature -- poems,
perhaps, some short and some epic.  Then there are codes that are the
equivalent of a technical report: functional, thorough, competently
written, and not necessarily that interesting to read.  You're glad
someone else has done the work, but you'd prefer just to cite it (or
call it as a subroutine) and not wade through the details.  Then
there are codes that reek of the sort of desperation that comes from
writing a term paper in an all-nighter just before it is due; this
image comes frequently to mind when I read code from some students.

And then there are the codes that resemble nothing so much as the bad
poetry that sometimes gets read in cafes around college towns.  These
are the codes where the author is clearly ecstatic about all the
clever things that he can do with his language, even though you really
wish that he wouldn't.  Sometimes, they rise to a sort of awful,
accidental art form at which one can only marvel.  When I see
these, I can never decide whether they've made my day, or ruined it.
Either way, I try to avoid repeating the experience.
