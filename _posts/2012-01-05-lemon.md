I mentioned [gmllua](http://www.bitbucket.org/dbindel/gmllua) before --
this is the little tool that I wrote to translate GML files into
Lua data structures for further processing.  I've been pretty happy with it.
Alas, text formats like GML aren't the most compact things, so I've taken
to compressing the GML files on my drive that are associated with large
networks.  It's easy to read and write gzip files using 
[zlib](http;//www.zlib.net/), which has an interface that looks a lot like the
standard C I/O interface.  So, I thought, why not glue zlib into gmllua
so that I can read either plain GML files or gzipped GML files with the same
code?

This should have been a simple task.  It probably would have been a simple task
if flex were designed a little differently.  But flex is what it is, and what
it is seems particularly ill suited to easily switching between multiple I/O
libraries.  It didn't take long for me to figure this out, and to decide that
I didn't really want to hack the generated code (though that probably would
have been the fastest thing to do).  This is not the first time that I've been
frustrated by the organization of flex and bison, so I decided that this was
a good excuse to try something different: a parser generated using
[Lemon](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/)
and a lexer generated with
[re2c](http://re2c.org/).  It took about half a day to figure it out and make
the port, despite the terse documentation.

I considered doing something with 
[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) as well, since it can supposedly 
generate C output.  But I actually like LALR(1), and I really liked how
neatly the stack associated with the LR parse matched the stack-oriented
Lua interface.  And anyhow, it was pretty clear how to wire up re2c to
read from different types of streams (since re2c doesn't actually care
how it gets the data).  Huzzah for small, sharp tools!
