title: About
---

I'm a mathematician and computer scientist who sometimes moonlights as an
engineer (electrical or mechanical, you decide).  I'm also an assistant
professor at Cornell.  You can learn about what I work on, or at least what I
worked on when I last updated my web pages,
[here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel).

This is a place for writings that are largely tangential to what I work on,
even if a worrisome number of them end up being about teaching.
