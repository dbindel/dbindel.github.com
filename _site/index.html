  <p>I have moved these pages from the Cornell CS web server to
<a href="http://github.com">github</a>.  There are a few simple reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I have other stuff that I really should be doing instead, but I&rsquo;m
cross-eyed from working on technical things all weekend.  Moving
files from point A to point B lets me coast for a few minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I&rsquo;m already using Jekyll, so there&rsquo;s no real friction to the move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is real friction to using the CS web server, since I have to
be logged into the Cornell VPN in order to get to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve done a bit of coding this summer that I keep intending to move
up to Github.  This seems like a good first step.</p>

  <p>The Detroit airport is loud a lot of the time.  Most airports are.
Every few moments, there is a TSA announcement, or a gate
announcement, or a request that someone go to the courtesy telephone.
The tram that runs from one end of the terminal to the other rumbles
overhead.  And, of course, there is a constant bustle of people.</p>

<p>But in the moments between all that, you can hear the birds in the
rafters.  I&rsquo;m not sure how they got inside; and if they get in with
any regularity, I imagine the maintenance crews view them as pests.
But here and now, I&rsquo;m glad to hear them.</p>

  <p>I get enough requests for student referrals from potential employers
that it seems like I should put together a standard polite response to
them.  This is that polite response.</p>

<p>The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), of which
Cornell is a member, publishes a
<a href="http://www.naceweb.org/legal/faculty_guide/">Faculty Guide to Ethical and Legal Standards in Student Hiring</a>.
According to this guide, it is recommended that we redirect requests
for student referrals to
<a href="http://www.career.cornell.edu/">Cornell Career Services</a> so that it can
be posted openly for qualified candidates.
Given that Cornell makes it
<a href="http://www.career.cornell.edu/employers/hiring_students/posting/index.cfm">free to employers</a>
to post full-time jobs, internships, and summer positions for current
students and recent grads (up to five years out), this seems like the
best strategy both for me and for any employers who might want to hire
my students.  Also, Career Services has people who help match people
with opportunities, schedule interviews, etc.
In any event, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
does not generally allow my to disclose student information outside
Cornell without prior consent of the student, so the best I can do is
to advertise, and Career Services is generally better at advertising
such things than I am.</p>

<p>Also, if you want to hire our top students, get a head start.  Many of
our top undergraduates have jobs lined up by the end of the fall
semester.</p>

  <p>The CS department has an espresso machine, which I basically never
use.  For a while after the kitchen was spruced up, we had a simple
one-button model.  But that kept breaking down, until one day it
disappeared and was replaced by an older version.  I could learn to
use it, I suppose, but most days, I just make a pot of coffee with the
coffee maker in my office.  And whe I want something a little fancier,
I will go out.</p>

<p>Today was a day to go out.  The carpet in my office was just cleaned
this morning, so I&rsquo;m trying to avoid working there; and in any event,
sometimes I enjoy a change of scenery.  So for now, I&rsquo;m sitting in
Starbucks, having just finished one task and getting ready to move on
to the next one.</p>

  <p>I turned in my grades last Friday, then spent the next several days
away from Ithaca on travel.  I was going for family reasons, but many
others in the department seem to have chosen this week for travel for
professional reasons.  Whatever the reasons, a trip away is a good
bookend to the semester.</p>

<p>Spring is over.  Summer is here.  It is a time for quiet and
concentration, a time when I can work in a straight line for eight
hours or more without the distraction of meetings or knocks at the
door.  I love it.</p>

    </h2>

  <p>A couple weeks ago, a tree that grew at the edge of our property blew
down during a windstorm.  It fell on a steep slope covered with vines
&ndash; vinca, I think &ndash; and it was drattedly difficult to get to.  I let
it sit for a couple weekends, not wanting to tackle a task that
involved sharp tools and a steep slope when that slope was also wet.
But this weekend, the weather is fine.  So yesterday morning, I got a
saw and a rope from Lowes, and I set to cutting and hauling.  The work
went surprisingly quickly, and after about two hours, we had a brush
pile and some logs to finish cutting into firewood.  And that was
that.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, a bit after the tree fell, I agreed with one of my
students that I was going to help him write the code for describing
boundaries in our finite element code.  After staring at it for a
while, I decided the right way to handle the boundary curve was to
generate a Chebyshev polynomial approximation to a parametric
description provided by the user as part of a larger mapped block mesh
generator.  So on Thursday this week, I sat down and wrote and tested the
code to fit that parametric approximation, evaluate it quickly, and
get the derivatives that I need to compute surface normals.  It took
about the same amount of time to get the basic functionality working
as it took me to chop up the tree.  And, like cutting up the tree, it
felt pretty good to get it out of the way.</p>

    </h2>
    <h5><time>May  6, 2012</time></h5>

  <p>This morning, I uploaded the grades for the third project that I
assigned for my scientific computing class this semester.  The project
involved understanding the behavior of a thermal ignition model, and
involved several steps.  In each step, there was an approximation.  At
the end of the assignment, I asked the students how many digits of
their answers they believed, and why.  I did say that it was okay to
not be rigorous, and that experimental evidence and convergence plots
were fine.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t do so well at this.  This difficulty made the project
tremendously difficult to grade.  It also set me to thinking about the
nature of teaching error analysis in an introductory scientific
computing class.</p>

<p>Few of my students should ever have to re-implement the basic
algorithms they learn in this class.  There are standard libraries
that include good implementations of many of these methods, and the
authors of those standard libraries spend time to make sure the
implementations they provide are as robust and flexible as possible.
The same is true of an introductory algorithms course, though: for the
most part, the world does not need another implementation of
quicksort, and it certainly does not need another implementation of
bubblesort.  What it needs is people who <em>understand</em> sorting
algorithms well enough so that they can make intelligent choices
between competing methods.  In the case of sorting, that means
understanding the effects of different key distributions, how
nearly-sorted data differs from completely-unsorted data, and the care
and maintenance of asymptotic complexity results.  In the case of
numerical methods, that means understanding how different methods rely
on different problem characteristics, and the differences in
efficiency and error that ensue.  The important question is not &ldquo;how
can I compute X,&rdquo; but &ldquo;how can I compute X with enough speed and
accuracy to attain my higher-level goal Y.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I just want to make sure that any bridges my
students might build don&rsquo;t fall down because they believed their
simulations too much.  My conclusion from this project is that I hope
many of my students are not allowed to build bridges without
supervision in the immediate future.</p>

  <p>It takes me more than five minutes to write the typical email,
anything beyond a one-line response that says that I can meet or that
my office hours have been moved.  Writing anything more technical, I
move at a glacial pace.  This is not a good thing, and I know it.</p>

<p>One of the ways that I try to keep myself from overthinking things is
by writing with a pen.  I type faster than I can think through my
sentences at times, so I&rsquo;m always stuck hitting backspace from time
to time when I use the computer.  But I write more slowly, which
paradoxically means that I often end up producing more writing per
unit of time with a pen than with a keyboard, only because I throw
less of it away.  And this feels a little silly.  It&rsquo;s the product of
habits that I should be able to revise or work around.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s work on revising or working around those habits.  This is my
experiment: the five minute masterpiece.  I sit and type for five
minutes, and whatever is done at the end of that time, I post.  It
could be me writing about something technical or something absurd; the
only rule is that it must be done quickly, with a minimum of fretting
over revision.  Also, ideally, it should involve only very brief
seconds where I stare off into space and try to marshal my thoughts
into words, rather than periods of a minute or two.</p>

<p>At the moment, I have a sleeping baby sitting in front of me, and she
is starting to stir.  That&rsquo;ll keep me honest for today.  What will I
do to manage this more generally?  I don&rsquo;t know, but I imagine I&rsquo;ll
figure something out!</p>
